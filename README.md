# StealthCalculator
A stealthy background calculator

This is a simple-ish calculator that runs on the background and with the use of the numpad allows you to do math quickly without opening up any other application. 

Only issue is that it uses up a lot of your CPU and I can't figure out how to make it you less, so I hope that y'all will be able to help <3

If anyone is smart enough to please help make this more efficient I would love you forever!
